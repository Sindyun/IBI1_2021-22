Week 4: the feedback said my commit message is not so informative. I should add more information to introduce myself.
Week 5: the feedback indicated in triangle.py my pseudocode should be more detailed, so I add more words to explain my code.
Week 6: I add labels and titles to my scatter and boxplot. plt.title('The effect of paternal age on offspring health')
plt.xlabel('Paternal age') 
plt.ylabel('chd') (in the scatterplot)
plt.xlabel("score")(in the boxplot)
Also, I add more pseudocodes. 
I create a variable for age that can be modified and print the risk of chd in the offspring.
age="30" #use age 30 as an example, and this can be modified. 
print("The risk of chd for the offspring when paternal age equals to " + age + " is " + str(chd[age]) +".")
