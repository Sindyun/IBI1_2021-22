Week 4: the feedback said my commit message is not so informative. I should add more information to introduce myself.
Week 5: the feedback indicated in triangle.py my pseudocode should be more detailed, so I add more words to explain my code.
Week 6: I add labels and titles to my scatter and boxplot. Also, I add more pseudocodes. 
I create a variable for age that can be modified and print the risk of chd in the offspring.
